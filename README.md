# RaftMod.CustomMaxRaftSpeed

Gives you the ability to customize the maximum raft speed.

## Usage

- **maxspeed x** (where x is a factor between 1 to 20) - Sets the maximum speed from 100% to 2000%.

## Known issues:

It seems like the maximum speed is throttled to a certain value, so don't expect much when setting the value to 20. The maximum that this mod does allow, is (imho) fast enough.
